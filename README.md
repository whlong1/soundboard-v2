# Soundboard-v2

[Deployed Link](https://sound-board-react-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

Soundboard is an online music repository. Soundboard utilizes the [TheAudioDB API](https://www.theaudiodb.com) to organize information on recording artists in a user-friendly interface. 

This repo is an update of a simple Web app I created for a Unit 1 project at General Assembly. Changes to TheAudioDB endpoints necessitated introducing a backend to secure the newly required API key. The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/whlong1/soundboard).
